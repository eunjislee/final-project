# Project Outline
> Created by Eunji for COMP 290: Essential Tools for Computer Science.

In the project outline, you will specify details about the type of application that you will develop. Your project outline should answer the following questions:

## Project Idea

**What type of project will you work on? Will it be a web app, mobile app, or something else?  What will your project do?**

The project I am developing is a virtual pet app designed for iOS, with a focus on promoting mindfulness and relaxation. This app will feature a virtual pet that acts as a support companion for users, helping them engage in mindful practices daily. Users will be prompted to check in with their mood each day, using a 5-point scale to indicate how they feel. The pet will respond to the user’s input, acknowledging their emotional state and will suggest tailored mindfulness exercises such as meditation sessions, breathing exercises or calming activities. To further support wellness, the app will send notifications throughout the day with words of affirmation and gentle reminders for basic needs, like remembering to eat or hydrate. There will also be an option to create a to-do list for the day, promoting productivity.

Designed with university students in mind, the app also includes a “study mode” with a customizable Pomodoro timer. During study breaks, the app will suggest mindful activities or brief exercises to help users relax and reset before resuming their work.

The visuals of the app will provide a warm and comforting feeling to the user, with hand-drawn visuals made for the UI. The virtual pet will reside in a customizable environment where users can adjust the scenery and even dress their pet in different outfits, enhancing both the personalization and appeal to the app.


**Why did you choose to work on this project? What motivates you to choose this topic?**

I chose to work on this project to help university students in managing their mental health. Having struggled with mental health myself and seeing friends face similar challenges, I understand how overwhelming balancing academics and self-care can be. After losing someone close to me to mental health struggles, I felt a strong drive to create something that could bring awareness and provide support. This project is my way of offering a safe and encouraging virtual space where students can practice mindfulness, and manage stress. I hope that this app will remind users to take care of themselves on a daily basis, and help in their journey towards wellness.
## Project Impact

**Who is the target audience of this project? Be specific about the demographic (age / occupation), the type of devices they might use to run it (computer, Apple phone, smartwatch, etc).**

The target audience of this app are young adult university students, having an age range from 18-24. I chose this demographic because their experiences and challenges resonate closely with my own, and I want to create something meaningful that directly benefits my peers. I feel that many students often neglect their well being due to heavy coursework, so I believe that creating an app that sends reminders to take care of themselves will be beneficial to students.

Since the app is designed for iOS, it will cater specifically to students who use Apple devices. According to the pew Research Center, 97% of university students own a smartphone, making a mobile app an effective tool for reaching students where they are most active and connected. As a student, I know that I actively check my phone multiple times throughout the day, and having multiple notifications a day from this app would definitely catch my attention. The app will be created specifically for Apple phones, however it would be exciting to explore an Apple watch widget with a smaller interface with limited features, such as the customizable pomodoro timer or the option to play with the virtual pet. For simplicity purposes, I think that keeping it as an Apple phone app is sufficient.

**What problem does your project hope to tackle? How will your final product help to solve this problem? How will the target audience you specified above benefit from your project?**

This project aims to address high levels of stress and mental health challenges found among university students. This app will not be enough to solve the problem of mental health issues, but I hope it will be a starting point for students to start their journey in self care. By offering a virtual pet app focused on mindfulness and relaxation, I hope to provide students with a fun and comforting tool that makes self-care more accessible. The pet will act as a companion, encouraging users to check in with their mood, engage in breathing exercises, and provide words of affirmation throughout the day. I hope that the visual appeal of the virtual pet will also keep students engaged with the app on a daily basis.

The final product will help students manage their mental health through small tasks provided by the app. The app’s daily reminders to take care of basic needs and necessary breaks will foster a routine of positive habits. These moments of mindful engagement will overtime, help students manage stress, boost resilience, and improve their overall well-being. The app will encourage students to take time for themselves, creating a healthy balance between their academic and personal life.
