# COMP 290 Final Project

**Congratulations, we are getting close to the end of the semester!** ðŸ¥³âœ¨ In lieu of a final exam, the final deliverable for COMP 290 will be a final project. For this project, you will develop an action plan for creating an extracurricular software engineering side project of your choice! By the end of the project, you will learn about how to develop software project ideas, research new technologies, read documentation, and develop a timeline to make meaningful progress on such ideas. You will also have developed a full plan to work on a real-world project that showcases the software engineering skills you will develop during your time as a Computer Science major here at UNC, which you can put on your GitHub profile, resume and personal portfolio. While working on this final project, you will also make tangible progress to learning the programming language and / or tools of your choice that will help you progress towards your goals.

**The instructions for the final project are listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14aFcmYzlEPAjyMSxd0BhFJi84dbnDYGovJL1uMixT5M/).** Please read over these instructions before returning to this repository.

## Repository Structure

This GitHub classroom repository is where you will complete all of the final project work before submitting to GradeScope. This repository is split into three folders:

- **`/proposal/`**: This folder is where you will complete your project proposal. Specifically:
    - `OUTLINE.md`: This file contains instructions and the template for the final project outline. You will *edit this file* to include your final outline responses.
    - `sketches/INSTRUCTIONS.md`: This folder contains instructions on how to submit your wireframe sketches. Please read over this file and follow the instructions.
- **`/getting-started/INSTRUCTIONS.md`**: This folder and file contains instructions on how to submit your Getting Started tutorial solutions. Please read over this file carefully and follow the instructions.
- **`/action-plan/PLAN.md`**: This folder and file containsthe template for your final action plan. You will *edit this file* to include your final action plan.

## Getting Started

Now that you have accepted this assignment, you can follow the instructions to clone it (download the repository to your local computer).
1. Click on the green `<> Code` button on the top right of the home page of **your accepted assignment** repository.
2. Copy the link with the `HTTP` tab selected.
3. In Terminal on your local machine, `cd` into a folder where you would like the repository to be stored locally.
4. Run `git clone <copied URL here>`
5. This should download this repository to your current machine!

As you work, make sure to add commits to save your progress. You can choose to work solely on the `main` branch, or for more practice, feel free to create branches for each step and merge them back into `main` later. As a reminder, these are the steps to make a commit and push to GitHub:
1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "<commit msg here>"`
3. `git push origin <branch name: usually main>`

If you are working with multiple branches, remember the steps to merge branches back into `main`:
1. `git switch main`
2. `git merge <branch-name>`
3. Solve any conflicts as done in *a05*, if necessary.

You can also open a *pull request* on GitHub's website and merge that way instead, if needed.

**If you have questions or issues, please reach out to either Ajay or Noah!**
