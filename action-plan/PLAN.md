# Action Plan

> Created by Eunji for COMP 290: Essential Tools for Computer Science

The final task of your final project is to create an action plan for the project / idea you have come up with. Below serves as a template outlining the expectations for your outline. You will receive full points as long as you make a good-faith effort in creating goals and good tasks for each month. You can also choose which months you would like to include in the 6-month action plan.

Final reminder, please note COMP 290's policies towards generative AI use in the course syllabus:

> All students are expected to follow the guidelines of the UNC Honor Code. Students may use artificial intelligence tools such as ChatGPT to reinforce or explain concepts, but never to complete assignments, generate code to submit on assignments, or generate text to submit for assignments - ***especially on the final project submission***. Doing so is an Honor Court violation and will result in a 0 on that portion of an assignment. For programming assignment submissions, you must understand and be able to explain any code snippet, derivation, or generated code you make use of in your work if asked by an instructor.

Believe it or not, it is quite easy for instructors to tell when students paste in ChatGPT's responses into their submissions without any editing. If you have any questions towards this policy, please reach out to either Ajay or Noah.

## Month 1 - May 

### Goals
**What would you like to accomplish in this three week period? This can either be learning a new skill or working on your project. Include three bullet points in this section, each should be ~2-3 sentences.**

- Look through all of the symbol image options for the different pages the app will have. I will also learn if its feasible to create custom symbol images, to closer match my wireframe sketch 
- Watch video tutorials on Swift that reflect the pages that I would like to have in my project. I found a tutorial to create a to-do list and will watch and follow along. 
- Create the project ComfortCompanion on Xcode. I would like to start by creating different pages for journaling, breathing exercises, the home page, pomodoro timer, and to-do list. 

### Tasks
**Write a checklist of tasks to complete. When you are following this plan, you should use these tasks to drive your progress and stay focused! To accomplish this, your tasks should be clear, granular, and not overloaded. Try to include ~4 tasks in this section, adjusting more or less as needed based on the goal for this three week period. Note, if you are consistently including only 1-2 tasks per period, you are likely not being clear and granular enough.**

- [ ] Todo: Read through Official Apple Documentation of creating custom symbol images.
- [ ] Todo: Create the ComfortCompanion project on Xcode. Create the HomePage, JournalPage, BreathingPage, PomodoroPage, and ToDoPage. 
- [ ] Todo: Watch and follow along a To-Do List Swift tutorial in the ToDoPage. 
- [ ] Todo: Find icons provided by Xcode that can be used in case creating custom symbol images is too difficult. 

### Extra Resources
**Try to include 1-2 extra resources in this section that can help you complete your task. You may just paste a link for each here.**
